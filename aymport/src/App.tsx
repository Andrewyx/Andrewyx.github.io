        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have a mixed background in software and hardware design, 
          with experience with languages such as Python, C++, and C#. 
          I am a hardware hobbyist with proficiency in many design programs 
          such as Autodesk Inventor, Fusion360, Ultimaker Cura, Fritzing, and the Arduino IOT Cloud.
          I absolutely adore game design, so if you ever have an idea you would like to share or
           would simply like to try out some of my projects, I would love to connect with you!
